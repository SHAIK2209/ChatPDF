## 📘 PDF Question Answering Chatbot (Local GenAI App)

A Streamlit-based GenAI app that allows users to upload a PDF and ask questions about its contents using a local HuggingFace model (Flan-T5-Base).
No API key required. Runs **100% locally**.


🧠 Features

* ✅ Upload any readable text-based PDF
* ✅ Extracts and chunks the content for context search
* ✅ Ask natural language questions about the PDF
* ✅ Powered by open-source models (`flan-t5-base`, `MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* ✅ No internet or OpenAI API key required after setup
* ✅ Clean, user-friendly Streamlit UI

```

#### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
| Package                   | Purpose                                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `streamlit`               | Web interface to run the app in your browser                          |
| `PyMuPDF` (`fitz`)        | To extract readable text from PDF documents                           |
| `langchain`               | Framework for chaining embeddings, vector search, and language models |
| `faiss-cpu`               | Vector store to store and search PDF text chunks efficiently          |
| `transformers`            | Loads local HuggingFace models like `flan-t5-base`                    |
| `sentence-transformers`   | Provides powerful embedding models like `MiniLM-L6-v2` for similarity |
| `torch`                   | Backend required to run models from `transformers`                    |
| `accelerate` *(optional)* | Speeds up model loading, safe to include                              |

```

#### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
